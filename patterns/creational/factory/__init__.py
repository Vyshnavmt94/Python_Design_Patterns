# ========================================= Factory Method ==========================================
# Factory Method is a Creational Design Pattern that allows an interface or a class to create an object, but lets subclasses decide which class or object to instantiate.
# Here, objects are created without exposing the logic to the client, and for creating the new type of object, the client uses the same common interface.


# ========================================= AbstractFactory Method ==========================================
# Allows you to produce the families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
# It provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories.
# Basically, here we try to abstract the creation of the objects depending on the logic, business, platform choice, etc.
